# tournament-planner-web

A flutter web application which serves as a turnament planner. As an admin I should be able to setup the teams and the group size and also the different tournament modes. I can choose how many fields are played on and fill in the scores of the games. It should automatically update the tournament plan according to the outcome of a game. I also want to provide a public site that lets the participants view the current state of the tournament and their game scores and tables.
